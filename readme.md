In this project we explore 3 different applications of sparsity

## Compressive sensing
 Compressive sensing is a signal processing technique that enables the reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals using a small number of measurements. It exploits the fact that signals can often be represented in a sparse form, allowing for efficient acquisition and reconstruction with reduced data requirements.
 
## Matrix recovery
The objective is to find a low-rank matrix that best fits the observed data, leveraging techniques such as nuclear norm minimization to achieve accurate recovery even when the observed measurements are missing or corrupted. Can be used in recommendation systems as well.

## Smooth-sparse decomposition
Smooth-sparse decomposition is a signal processing technique that aims to represent a signal as a combination of two components: a smooth component and a sparse component. The smooth component represents the underlying trends or low-frequency information in the signal, while the sparse component captures the abrupt changes or high-frequency details.
